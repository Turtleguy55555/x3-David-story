There once was a boy named James. James loved to eat apples.
Jame's favorite place was the town's local apple patch.
One day, James snuck into the apple patch and ate so many apples that his 
stomach started to hurt. His stomach growled and growled until James
threw up all over the apple patch. James panicked, if the farmer saw the mess
he made, he was surely to get punished.
