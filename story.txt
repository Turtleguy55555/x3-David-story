There once was a boy named James. James loved to eat apples.
Jame's favorite place was the town's local apple patch.
One day, James snuck into the apple patch and ate so many apples that his 
stomach started to hurt. His stomach growled and growled until James
threw up all over the apple patch. James panicked, if the farmer saw the mess
he made, he was surely to get punished.

After carefully considering all the possible solutions, he realized that it 
was impossible for him to clean up all the mess before the farmer saw it. So,
he decided to solve this problem by eliminating the farmer. If he could ensure
that the farmer would never find all the mess, then there wouldn't be any
problem.

After he eliminated the farmer, the cops came. SWAT showed up as this was
a murder. It was an incredibly gruesome scene, and the whole town gathered 
to watch. Criminal minds quickly did anepisode on James and his pumpkin
patch. James is still in prison today, maximum security, lifetime 
sentences. 

However, James would not let his life in prison deter him for his crimial
tendencies. He became the leader of all the prisoners in the prison 
and one day, he led a large break out allowing him to escape the prison.

SWAT soon realized his escape. Several tanks and chops were send out to kill him.
James then hide into a forest with his men. They discovered a hole with numerous weapens inside.
He got an MP7. He played COD for hundreds of hours. He definitely know how to use this weapon.
His men got a lot of MP5 and AKM. They began to shoot at those soldiers. "All enemies down!" 
he shouted out, "Holy shit, a Chopgunner, bring me RPG!" His man handed an RPG. He aimed at that chop
and shoot it down.
